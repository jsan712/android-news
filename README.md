# CSCI 4237 - Project 1 - Android News
Android News is a simple app to aggregate news from multiple sources. It can be used to view top headlines for broad categories, perform specific term searches, view news from specific sources, and view local news in different areas of the world!

## Getting Started
1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Create a new Android Studio project (min SDK version of API 21 or API 23). During the initial project setup, set the `Save location` to the folder that was created when you cloned this repo (e.g. so you can commit your project back into this repo).
3. Use git to add, commit, and push your new project to the `master` / `main` branch - now you have your starting point set locally and on GitHub! You are now ready to get started.
4. Don't forget to branch before you create commits - you'll need to create Pull Requests for the major project deliverables.
